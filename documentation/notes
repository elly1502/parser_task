Task
Program used by lab to check difference in an LRG between different builds.
1. Pull out the coding region.
2. Anything changed between 37 and 38 builds.

User stories
- Small command line program used by lab to check difference in an LRG between different builds.
- Script to be used on few machines (i.e. not a program with a website interface).
-	Take in an XML file for a specific gene.
-	Display the coding region sequence to user for all transcripts if applicable (with RefSeq id).
-	Pull out coordinates for each build. Display to user.
-	If a difference detected highlight to user. Display the difference it says in the file.

-------
Architecture:
- ElementTree module.
- If no diff tag then print no difference to user.

Functions:
1. Loads the XML file into Python.
2. Pull coordinates for coding regions for all transcripts, pull out Genomic sequence, displays coding
region by uses index of the coordinate relative to the sequence. Display comments related to transcripts.
3. Display the build coordinates to user.
4. Display difference between builds data.

------
Tests:
- Use a dummy xml file with specific tags that the program should look for.
- If no data between tags - then throw an error (assert).
- Test using xml file with a difference(s) and one without, does it handle multiple differences?
- Dummy xml file with none of the specific tags.
- Non xml file.
- xml file with data missing i.e. no genomic sequence to refer back to.

------
Questions:
-	Do we need the builds?

Additional ideas
-	User input gene â€“ looks up what XML file to load into python.
