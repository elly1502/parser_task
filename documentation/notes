Task

1. Pull out the coding region.
2. Anything changed between 37 and 38 builds.

Ideas
- XML file with a difference between builds.
-	User input gene â€“ looks up what XML file to load into python.

User stories
-	Take in an XML file for a specific gene.
-	Display the coding region sequence to user for all transcripts if applicable (with RefSeq id).
-	Pull out coordinates for each build.  Display to user.
-	If a difference detected highlight to user. Display the difference it says in the file.


Architecture & Tests






Questions:
-	Do we need the builds?
