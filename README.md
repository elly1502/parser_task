# parser_task

The parser_task directory contains three files: run.py, xml_parser.py and tests_xml_parser.py

run.py calls functions defined in xml_parser.py to do the following: 
  1. Loads the xml_file
  2. Prints the number of transcripts
  3. Prints each transcript in relation to LRG sequence and any comments related to the sequence
  4. Prints the build information within the LRG file including: reference co-ordinates of the builds and any differences between the builds
